You have have no
idea on how to drive to the conference. What do you do? You could try map quest
or google maps. I tried that and wasn't too pleased with the results I got.
Granted they both picked the fastest routes, however since the distance I'm
traveling isn't that great, I'd rather have a simpler route, especially if I'm
going to drive during rush hour. So on a whim I fired up Google Earth and dug
through the various layer files I could turn on. To my amazement I found that
it had the DC Metro. Turns out the metro is much closer to the conference than
I gave it credit for. So now instead of driving during rush hour I'm gonna take
the train. Thanks, Google!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="life"></category></entry></feed>

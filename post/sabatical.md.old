Summary: On Sabatical 
---
For the next three months, I'm on a sabatical from
[Capsule8](https://capsule8.com). To keep my wits about me and in general to
try and improve my writing and use of time I'm planning on updating this blog
more regularly. With that said I'm hoping to effectively use the time that I'm
not spending with my family doing some projects and reading.

Some project ideas:
  - A Github actions based app to create kubernetes clusters in a gitops style
    workflow
  - A Github actions based journal app
  - A vulnerability scanner for container images similar to [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)
  - Learning rust
  - Improving my C++11 skills
  - Relearning terraform
  - Relearning make & cmake
  - Writing lambdas / cloud functions
  - Getting even more familiar with Kubernetes and Other FaaS platforms
  - Getting familiar with kubernetes projects e.g. virtualkubelet, prow
  - [Moving the blog to hugo](https://gohugo.io/?ref=stackshare)
  - A few CTF / Reversing projects to get back in practice
  - Making some open source contributions
